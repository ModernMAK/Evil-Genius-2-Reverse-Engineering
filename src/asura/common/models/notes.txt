Name [bytes] ~ values

Asura Format:
MagicWord [8] ~ 'Asura   ', AsuraCmp, AsuraZlb, AsuraZbb
    I dont know what Cmp and Zbb mean; Compressed and Zip of some kind
    I consider these to only be two types; Archive and Compressed Archive
... See SubFormats ~ TODO WRITE SUBFORMAT NOTES

Asura

STSC Chunks
	Word ~ 4 bytes
	Word Size A ~ 4 Bytes
		Words A ~ 4 * A Size
	Word Size B ~ 4 Bytes
		Words B ~ 4 * B Size



VTEX Might be Block Count ~ Read in rest of chunk header / Block Count?
    This is based off one file and the coincidence that the first word is small, and was divisble by the file size
    Another coincidence; the last byte of every block was FF
        Actually, every word ends in FF WHICH MAKES SENSE IF THIS IS A 32 bit texture (RGBA) with no alpha!
